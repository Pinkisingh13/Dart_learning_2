Certainly! Let's go through each core data structure in Dart, one by one, with an explanation of its use cases, properties, and basic implementation examples.

---

### 1. **List**
A `List` in Dart is an ordered collection of items. You can think of it as an array.

- **Types**: Fixed-length and growable.
- **Common Use Cases**: Storing sequences of elements like numbers, strings, or objects.

```dart
void main() {
  // Growable list
  List<int> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
  numbers.add(5); // Adds 5 to the list
  print(numbers); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

  // Fixed-length list
  List<int> fixedList = List.filled(5, 0); // A list of length 5, initialized with 0
  fixedList[0] = 1;
  print(fixedList); // Output: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
}
```

---

### 2. **Set**
A `Set` is an unordered collection of unique elements.

- **Properties**: No duplicate values, faster lookup compared to `List`.
- **Common Use Cases**: Removing duplicates, checking membership.

```dart
void main() {
  Set<int> uniqueNumbers = {1, 2, 3, 3, 4};
  uniqueNumbers.add(5);
  print(uniqueNumbers); // Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

  // Check if a value exists
  print(uniqueNumbers.contains(3)); // Output: true
}
```

---

### 3. **Map**
A `Map` is a collection of key-value pairs, similar to a dictionary in other languages.

- **Properties**: Keys are unique; values can be duplicated.
- **Common Use Cases**: Associating keys with values, such as storing user details.

```dart
void main() {
  Map<String, String> userDetails = {
    'name': 'Pinki',
    'city': 'Delhi'
  };
  
  userDetails['email'] = 'pinki@example.com';
  print(userDetails); // Output: {name: Pinki, city: Delhi, email: pinki@example.com}

  // Access a value
  print(userDetails['name']); // Output: Pinki
}
```

---

### 4. **Stack**
A `Stack` is a LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) data structure. Dart doesn't have a built-in `Stack` class, but you can implement it using a `List`.

- **Common Use Cases**: Backtracking, undo functionality.

```dart
class Stack<T> {
  final List<T> _stack = [];

  void push(T value) => _stack.add(value);
  T pop() => _stack.removeLast();
  T peek() => _stack.last;
  bool get isEmpty => _stack.isEmpty;
}

void main() {
  var stack = Stack<int>();
  stack.push(10);
  stack.push(20);
  print(stack.peek()); // Output: 20
  print(stack.pop()); // Output: 20
  print(stack.isEmpty); // Output: false
}
```

---

### 5. **Queue**
A `Queue` is a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) data structure. Use Dart's `dart:collection` library.

- **Common Use Cases**: Task scheduling, breadth-first search in graphs.

```dart
import 'dart:collection';

void main() {
  Queue<int> queue = Queue<int>();
  queue.add(1);
  queue.add(2);
  queue.add(3);

  print(queue.removeFirst()); // Output: 1
  print(queue); // Output: [2, 3]
}
```

---

### 6. **Linked List**
Dart doesn't have a built-in linked list, so you can implement it using custom classes.

- **Common Use Cases**: Dynamic memory allocation, efficient insertions/deletions.

```dart
class Node<T> {
  T value;
  Node<T>? next;

  Node(this.value);
}

class LinkedList<T> {
  Node<T>? head;

  void add(T value) {
    if (head == null) {
      head = Node(value);
    } else {
      Node<T> current = head!;
      while (current.next != null) {
        current = current.next!;
      }
      current.next = Node(value);
    }
  }

  void display() {
    Node<T>? current = head;
    while (current != null) {
      print(current.value);
      current = current.next;
    }
  }
}

void main() {
  LinkedList<int> list = LinkedList<int>();
  list.add(10);
  list.add(20);
  list.add(30);
  list.display(); // Output: 10, 20, 30
}
```

---

### 7. **Tree**
A tree is a hierarchical data structure. Here's a basic binary tree implementation.

- **Common Use Cases**: Representing hierarchical data, search operations.

```dart
class TreeNode<T> {
  T value;
  TreeNode<T>? left;
  TreeNode<T>? right;

  TreeNode(this.value);
}

void main() {
  TreeNode<int> root = TreeNode(1);
  root.left = TreeNode(2);
  root.right = TreeNode(3);
  print(root.value); // Output: 1
}
```

---

### 8. **Graph**
Graphs are used to represent networks. You can implement them using adjacency lists or matrices.

- **Common Use Cases**: Representing relationships, social networks.

```dart
class Graph {
  Map<int, List<int>> adjacencyList = {};

  void addEdge(int u, int v) {
    adjacencyList.putIfAbsent(u, () => []).add(v);
    adjacencyList.putIfAbsent(v, () => []).add(u); // Undirected graph
  }

  void printGraph() {
    adjacencyList.forEach((key, value) {
      print('$key: $value');
    });
  }
}

void main() {
  Graph graph = Graph();
  graph.addEdge(1, 2);
  graph.addEdge(1, 3);
  graph.addEdge(2, 4);
  graph.printGraph();
  // Output:
  // 1: [2, 3]
  // 2: [1, 4]
  // 3: [1]
  // 4: [2]
}
```

                            **DART Architecture**


Dart is a versatile programming language developed by Google, designed for building high-performance, cross-platform applications. Understanding how Dart works and its architecture will help you deeply comprehend its capabilities and why it's well-suited for frameworks like Flutter. Here's a detailed explanation:

---

### **1. Dart Overview**
Dart is an object-oriented, class-based language with a focus on:
- **Productivity:** Easy syntax, similar to languages like JavaScript, Java, and C#.
- **Performance:** Compiles to optimized native code for apps.
- **Portability:** Runs on multiple platforms, including mobile, web, desktop, and server.
- **Expressiveness:** Rich support for functional programming, collections, and asynchronous code.

---

### **2. Dart Architecture**
Dart's architecture is designed to support its use in multiple environments. Its core components are:

#### **a. Dart SDK**
The Dart Software Development Kit (SDK) includes:
- **Dart VM:** A virtual machine that executes Dart code in a Just-In-Time (JIT) manner during development.
- **Dart DevTools:** A suite of debugging and performance tools.
- **dart2js Compiler:** Compiles Dart code to JavaScript for web applications.
- **dart CLI:** Command-line tools for running and managing Dart programs.
- **Package Manager (pub):** Used to manage dependencies.

#### **b. Compilation Pipeline**
Dart supports multiple compilation methods, depending on the target environment:

1. **Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compilation**  
   - Converts Dart code to optimized native machine code.
   - Used for Flutter apps and server-side apps for fast execution and small binary size.

2. **Just-in-Time (JIT) Compilation**  
   - Compiles Dart code dynamically during execution.
   - Used during development for hot reload and hot restart, making the development cycle fast.

3. **Transpilation (dart2js)**  
   - Converts Dart code to JavaScript for running on web browsers.
   - Ensures compatibility with modern web standards.

#### **c. Core Libraries**
Dart includes a rich set of core libraries to handle common tasks:
- **dart:core:** Provides essential classes (e.g., String, List, Map).
- **dart:async:** Handles asynchronous programming and streams.
- **dart:io:** Offers file, socket, and HTTP communication.
- **dart:html:** Used for web development to interact with the DOM.
- **dart:ffi:** Facilitates interoperability with native C libraries.

#### **d. Garbage Collection**
Dart uses a **mark-and-sweep garbage collector** to manage memory efficiently. Objects no longer referenced are automatically cleaned up, reducing memory leaks.

---

### **3. Dart Execution Workflow**
1. **Source Code:** You write Dart code in `.dart` files.
2. **Compilation:**  
   - JIT for development.
   - AOT or dart2js for production.
3. **Execution:**  
   - Dart VM executes the code for development.
   - Compiled native code or JavaScript runs in production.
4. **Interaction with Libraries:** Core libraries and external packages are used to extend functionality.

---

### **4. Dart's Role in Flutter**
Flutter is built entirely using Dart, leveraging its features for UI and application logic:
- **Reactive UI Programming:** Dart's asynchronous programming with `Future` and `Stream` makes it easy to handle user interactions and data updates.
- **Hot Reload:** Enabled by Dart's JIT compilation.
- **Cross-Platform:** AOT compilation ensures apps run natively on iOS and Android.

---

### **5. Key Features That Define Dart's Architecture**
- **Null Safety:** Helps prevent null reference errors at compile time.
- **Sound Type System:** Combines static and dynamic typing.
- **Asynchronous Programming:** `async` and `await` make handling asynchronous operations straightforward.
- **Isolates:** Provides thread-like behavior for concurrent execution without shared memory.
