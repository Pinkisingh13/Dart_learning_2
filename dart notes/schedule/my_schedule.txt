Thank you for sharing your journey and challenges in detail. Here's a tailored plan to help you achieve your goals efficiently:

### 1. **Focus on Dart DSA Basics First**
   - **Learn Core Data Structures and Algorithms**: Start with a structured course or resource that teaches Dart-specific implementation of data structures (e.g., lists, sets, maps, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, graphs). Continue with Vandad Nahavandipoor's videos if they help.
   - **Practice Data Structure Implementation**: Implement basic structures like linked lists or stacks in Dart to get comfortable with using classes and extending them.
   - **Understand Dart's OOP Principles**: Deepen your understanding of classes, inheritance, and polymorphism, as these are crucial for using Dart effectively.

### 2. **Continue with LeetCode Smartly**
   - **Solve Easy Questions First**: Focus on easy questions related to arrays, strings, and hashmaps to build confidence.
   - **Learn Problem-Solving Patterns**: Study common patterns like sliding window, two pointers, and divide-and-conquer, and apply them to problems.
   - **Understand Solutions Thoroughly**: Even if you rely on solutions, analyze them deeply to identify the thought process.

### 3. **Integrate Flutter Learning**
   - Spend at least 3-4 hours daily on Flutter. Prioritize core concepts (widgets, state management, navigation, API integration) essential for job readiness.
   - Build small projects like to-do lists, weather apps, or a basic chat app to showcase your skills during internship interviews.

### 4. **Combine DSA and Flutter Practice**
   - Allocate time each day to both DSA and Flutter. For example:
     - Morning: Solve 1-2 DSA problems.
     - Afternoon/Evening: Work on Flutter projects or tutorials.

### 5. **Prepare for Interviews**
   - Learn the basics of algorithms like sorting and searching.
   - Practice answering behavioral questions and explaining your projects.

### Suggested Weekly Schedule
| **Day**       | **Activity**                           | **Hours** |
|---------------|---------------------------------------|-----------|
| Monday-Friday | Dart DSA (concepts + problems)        | 2-3       |
|               | Flutter tutorials/projects            | 3-4       |
| Saturday      | Revise Dart topics + Solve DSA        | 3         |
|               | Work on a Flutter project             | 3         |
| Sunday        | Mock interview + Revision             | 4-5       |

### 6. **Find Support**
   - Join communities (e.g., Flutter, Dart, and LeetCode Discord/Reddit groups).
   - Share your progress and doubts with peers for feedback and motivation.

By focusing on both DSA and Flutter systematically, you'll enhance your problem-solving skills while building projects that make you job-ready. If you need more guidance or resources, let me know!
