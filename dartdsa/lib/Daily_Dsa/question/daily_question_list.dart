// 30 Days of Dart Questions

// Day 1: Lists & Spread Operator

// Write a function that takes two lists of integers and returns a new list that contains all the unique elements from both lists in sorted order. You must use the spread operator.

// Write a function that rotates a list to the right by k positions.
//! Solved Day 1


// Day 2: Sets

//1. Given a list of numbers, return a list containing only the unique elements (removing duplicates) while maintaining the order.

//2. Find the intersection of two sets in Dart.

// Day 3: Maps

// Given a map of students and their marks, write a function that returns a list of names of students who scored more than 75.

// Create a function that swaps the keys and values of a given map.

// Day 4: OOP - Classes & Objects

// Create a class Person with properties name and age. Implement a method describe() that prints "My name is {name} and I am {age} years old."

// Create a BankAccount class with deposit() and withdraw() methods that modify the balance.

// Day 5: OOP - Inheritance & Polymorphism

// Create a base class Shape with a method area(), then create two subclasses Circle and Rectangle that override area().

// Create a base class Animal with a method makeSound(). Extend it with Dog and Cat classes to provide different implementations.

// Day 6: Mixins & Extensions

// Create a mixin called Swimmer that has a method swim(). Apply it to Fish and Duck classes.

// Write an extension on String that adds a method isPalindrome() to check if a string is a palindrome.

// Day 7: Generics

// Create a generic function that reverses a list of any type.

// Implement a generic class Box<T> that stores an item of any type and provides a method getItem() to retrieve it.

// Day 8: Enums

// Create an enum Weather with values sunny, rainy, and cloudy. Write a function that prints an appropriate message based on the weather condition.

// Create an enum PaymentStatus and implement a function that returns different messages based on the status.

// Day 9: Iterables

// Given a list of numbers, use .where() to filter out even numbers.

// Given a list of names, use .map() to convert them all to uppercase.

// Day 10: late & Null Safety

// Demonstrate the use of late by creating a class Employee with a late property salary that is initialized after object creation.

// Given a nullable string, write a function that returns its length or 0 if it's null.

// Day 11: Collections & Functional Programming

// Implement a function that groups words by their first letter using a Map<String, List<String>>.

// Use .fold() to find the sum of a list of numbers.

// Day 12: Math Operations

// Write a function to calculate the factorial of a number recursively.

// Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using recursion.

// Day 13: Spread Operator & Collection Operations

// Merge multiple lists into one using the spread operator.

// Given a list of numbers, find the second largest number without sorting.

// Day 14: Synchronous & Asynchronous Programming

// Write an async function that waits for 2 seconds before returning "Hello, World!".

// Implement a function that fetches data using Future.delayed() and prints it.

// Day 15: Streams & Future

// Create a stream that emits numbers from 1 to 5 with a 1-second delay between emissions.

// Implement a function that listens to a stream and prints each emitted value.
